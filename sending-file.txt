From pixels sharp to data's gleam,
A new horizon, a vibrant dream.
You wielded color, form, and line,
Now algorithms intertwine.

The artist's eye, the steady hand,
Now seeks the patterns, close at hand.
Statistics whispers in your ear,
A language known, banishing fear.

No longer just the visual art,
But logic's canvas, set apart.
Python's call, a siren's song,
Where data dances, all day long.

The UI fades, the code takes hold,
A different story to unfold.
Each bracket placed, a careful stroke,
A data landscape you evoke.

From mockups clean to models deep,
The secrets that the datasets keep.
You'll wrangle, cleanse, and then explore,
The hidden truths you'll bring to shore.

No longer just the user's view,
But insights fresh, and knowledge new.
The power of the data's might,
To shape the future, dark or bright.

So code with passion, learn with grace,
Embrace the challenge, find your place.
The designer's mind, the statistician's skill,
A potent blend, that nothing can still.

For in this fusion, strong and bold,
A data scientist will unfold.
